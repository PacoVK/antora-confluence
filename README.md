# Captain - Confluence Antora Plugin To Aid Integration Nicely

[![Build](https://github.com/PacoVK/antora-confluence/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PacoVK/antora-confluence/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> NOTE: This plugin is in an early phase. It is still in development.

![Captain Logo](assets/captain.png)

This plugin is designed to help to publish your [Antora](https://antora.org/) docs into Confluence. The main reason is, that we want to have a single source of truth for our documentation. We want to write our documentation in AsciiDoc and publish it to Confluence as some of our Stakeholders are using Confluence.

The captain offers the following options:

- Publish your whole Antora docs to Confluence
- Publish only selected pages/ folders, by using filters
- Control where the docs should be published by setting an overall parent page in Confluence
- Decide if you want to inform your readers that those pages are generated by automation by applying a banner.

## References and Kudos

The code of the plugin was heavily inspired by [docToolchain](https://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/v2.0.x/), a swiss-army knife for docs-as-code.

## How it works

The plugin uses the Confluence REST API to create and update pages in Confluence. It uses the `confluence-space` to determine where to publish the pages. The plugin will create a page for each Antora page and will use the `title` and `content` of the page to create the Confluence page.

The plugin will also create a page tree to reflect the structure of the Antora pages in Confluence. Each Antora module version will be a child page of the page tree and the pages will be children of the module pages.

You can customize the page tree by using the `mapper` option. This will allow you to map Antora pages to Confluence pages and control the structure of the page tree.

## Installation

To install the plugin, you can use the following command in your Antora project:

```sh
npm install -D antora-confluence
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn add -D antora-confluence
```

## Usage

To use the plugin, you need to add it to your Antora project. You can do this by adding the following to your output section in `playbook.yml`:

```yaml
output:
  destinations:
    - provider: antora-confluence
      confluence-api: https://<redacted>.atlassian.net
      confluence-space: my-spacekey
```

### State Management

The Captain will keep track of the pages it has created in Confluence. This is to ensure that it does not create duplicate pages and to detect page renames. The state is stored in a dedicated page with `DRAFT` status called `Captain State Page` in the root of your Space, or if defined, right under your starting point defined via `ancestor-id` option. If you delete this page, the Captain will recreate it, but it will assume no page exist in the target space. This may lead to errors and the only solution is to delete all Pages managed by Captain. Per default Confluence Pages created in `DRAFT` status are only visible to the owner.

### Configuration

| Option           | Description                                                                                                                  | Info                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| confluence-api   | URL to your Confluence API endpoint                                                                                          | **required**               |
| confluence-space | The Confluence space key to publish the pages to                                                                             | **required**               |
| editor-version   | The Confluence editor version to use to create pages                                                                         | v1 (default) / v2          |
| filters          | Specify paths or files that you want to publish to Confluence                                                                | [] (default)               |
| ancestor-id      | Specify the overall parent page for your docs. Needs to be the pageId of the parent page, not the DisplayName.               | defaults to the space root |
| show-banner      | Specify if all your pages should contain an info banner, that this pages were created by automation and changes may be lost. | false (default)            |
| mapper           | Specify a custom mapper to map the Antora pages to Confluence pages.                                                         | [] (default)               |

#### Using Mappers

You can specify a list of custom mappers to map the Antora pages to Confluence pages. A mapper consists of `path` and `target`. The `path` is actually the Antora page path that you want to map and the `target` is the Confluence page title that you want to map to.

> Info: The below example would map the Antora page `module-a/1.0/example/manual` to the Confluence page `Manual`.

```yaml
output:
  destinations:
    - provider: antora-confluence
      confluence-api: https://<redacted>.atlassian.net
      confluence-space: my-spacekey
      mapper:
        - path: module-a/1.0/example/manual
          target: Manual
```

If you would not specify a mapper, the example above would create the following page tree in Confluence:

- module-a
  - 1.0
    - example
      - manual
        - AnyPage-That-exists-underneath-manual-directory

Using the mapper, you can control the page tree structure in Confluence. Hence, sticking to the example above, the page tree would look like this:

- Manual
  - AnyPage-That-exists-underneath-manual-directory

#### Using Filters

You can specify filters to only push certain files or folders instead of all. The filters must match the natural output structure of Antora. You can specify as many filters as you need. There are two different types of filters: `PathFilter` and `FileFilter`.

> Info: If the filtered pages do have cross-references to pages that are not within your filter, you may encounter broken links on Confluence. You are responsible that the subset of pages, applied through your filters are self-contained and all dependencies are covered.

To filter on a **specific directory**:

> Info: The below example would only publish all files within the folders `module-a/1.0/example` and `module-c/2.1/foo`

```yaml
output:
  destinations:
    - provider: antora-confluence
      confluence-api: https://<redacted>.atlassian.net
      confluence-space: my-spacekey
      filters:
        - path: module-a/1.0/example
        - path: module-c/2.1/foo
```

To filter on **specific files**:

> Info: The below example would only publish the three files, specfied by the filter

```yaml
output:
  destinations:
    - provider: antora-confluence
      confluence-api: https://<redacted>.atlassian.net
      confluence-space: my-spacekey
      filters:
        - files:
            - module-a/1.0/example/manual.html
            - module-a/1.0/example/troubleshoot.html
            - module-c/1.0/foo/examples.html
```

### Authentication

The plugin uses the `CONFLUENCE_USERNAME` and `CONFLUENCE_PASSWORD` to authenticate with the Confluence API. You can set these values in the environment variables.

#### Logging

You can set the log level of the plugin by setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable. The following levels are available:

- debug
- info (**default**)
- warn
